# movable-items
PyQt5 allows developers to define movable `QGraphicsItems` by setting the `itemIsMovable` flag, yet, this flag limits customization. The snippet in `movable_disk.py` shows how to achieve a similar result by implementing movable `QGraphicsItems` (here, a disk) w/o setting the `itemIsMovable` flag, but by redefining the handlers for mouse events. In this way we allow for a more customizable motility, as demonstrated in `movable_disk_group.py`: disks can now move individually (red disks) or altogether (green disks).
